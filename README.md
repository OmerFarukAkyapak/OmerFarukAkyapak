# ðŸŒ± My Interests
Since my university years, I've been deeply interested in Process Tracking, MES, MOM, and ERP systems. In 2021, I developed my first MES project with two talented colleagues, and that experience sparked my continued passion for these areas. Helping manufacturing companies optimize their processes and contribute to innovation excites me.
